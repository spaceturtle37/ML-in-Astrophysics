    "### Intro: Gravitational microlensing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a non-astronomer, you may or may not be familiar with **gravitational lensing**. Essentially, gravitational lensing occurs whenever a bright object appears behind a massive, dense object like a black hole or cluster of galaxies. This massive object is called the \"lens\", and gravity from the lens bends the light from the object in back. The result is that -- to observers on Earth -- the background object can appear distorted, and its light magnified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Below is a real image of gravitational lensing. Light from a blue spiral galaxy in the background is being magnified and warped by a red elliptical galaxy closer to us.\n",

    "For astronomers, it is easiest to detect gravitational lensing when the lens is an EXTREMELY large object -- typically a cluster of galaxies with trillions of times the mass of the Sun. However, we have now built survey telescopes to scan the sky for lensing from extremely small sources as well, including stars and planets that are small fractions of the Sun's mass. When the lens object is a single star or planet (rather than a whole galaxy), we call it a **microlensing event**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in action, [this microlensing demonstration from Ohio State University](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~gaudi/Movies/point.gif) shows a background star (red) passing behind a lens star (yellow). The light from the background star is both warped and magnified by the lens star.\n",

    "As Bayesians we have 4 questions to answer. \n",
    "1. What's the model?\n",
    "2. What's the Likelihood?\n",
    "3. What's the Prior on the model?\n",
    "4. How do you draw samples from the Posterior? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll tell you the model (question 1), and you've already written down the answer to question 4 in homework 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be modeling the **flux of a star over time, $F(t)$**. In astronomy, this called a **lightcurve**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a base flux $F_0$ for an object, a microlensing event can be modeled by the following lightcurve: \n",
    "\n",
    "## $$F(t) = F_0 \\frac{u(t)^2 + 2}{u(t)\\sqrt{u(t)^2+4}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "## $$u(t) = \\sqrt{p^2 + \\left( \\frac{t-t_\\mathrm{max}}{t_\\mathrm{E}} \\right)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $u(t)$ has 3 parameters you'll need to fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $t_\\mathrm{max}$ is the time of maximum. You should be able to read this off from a plot of the lightcurve\n",
    "\n",
    "* $t_\\mathrm{E}$ is called the \"Einstein crossing time\". You can get an initial guess for this from the plot\n",
    "\n",
    "* $p$ is the peak magnification. You can also get a guess of this and $F_0$ from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, let's parameterize the normalization of the model lightcurve in magnitudes rather than flux, i.e. $I_0$ rather than $F_0$; that way, all of the \"ref\" quantities in the magnitude definition are absorbed into this new parameter and we won't have to worry about them explicitly. With that substitution, the model parameters are $I_0$, $p$, $t_\\mathrm{max}$ and $t_\\mathrm{E}$. You'll of course also need the transformation between flux and magnitude, above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I suggest making plots of your model with a variety of parameters to understand how the model behaves as a function of the parameters above. Since you didn't come up with the model (Bohdan Paczyinski did in 1986) this is a useful thing to do, if only to see how it behaves qualitatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lacking any better information, we'll assume that the sampling distributions for the magnitude measurements are Gaussian and independent, with means given by the \"magnitude\" column and standard deviations given by the \"magnitude error\" column, and that the time stamps are exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do an MCMC fit of this microlensing model to your lightcurve data. This fit should be doable with your Metropolis-Hastings implementation. To do so, you'll need to have your MCMC walker return a series of random samples drawn from the posterior distribution on your model (the prior * the likelihood). Then, you'll need to return the \"best-fit\" value: The sample from your MCMC walk for which the posterior probability was the highest. This sample will be your best-fit model for the microlensing event. (This is extremely useful data for astronomers. They would be able to take this model and determine the properties of the lens mass, such as its total mass, its radius, and its offset from the background source.)**\n",

    "### IMPORTANT NOTE: Log probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you'll need to change something about your Metropolis-Hastings function. Last week your function took in a posterior probability function `func`, and evaluated it to obtain the posterior probability `p`. This worked when your probabilities were on the order of 10^-10 at the smallest. It will NOT work this week: For some models, your likelihood function will be on the order of 10^-1000 or smaller! Python cannot represent numbers this small, and rounds them to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instead of working with posterior probabilities, you'll need to make your Metropolis-Hastings function work with log probabilities.** To do so, you'll need to make two changes to your function.\n",
    "1. Instead of taking in a function `func(x) -> posterior`, your Metropolis-Hastings implementation should take in a function `logfunc(x) -> log_posterior`. In other words, the function your Metropolis-Hastings implementation takes in should calculate the **log** of the posterior.\n",
    "2. Instead of calculating the ratio $p(x') / p(x)$, your implementation should calculate $e\\text{^}[ \\text{log_p}(x') - \\text{log_p}(x) ]$. (Mathematically, these expressions are equal, but Python will round $p(x)/p(x')$ to $0/0$ if these probabilities are very small.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This should only require you to change a few lines in your Metropolis-Hastings function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution should include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code:** Expressions (in readable code, at a minimum) of the prior distributions and likelihood encoded. (I.e. question 2 for a Bayesian)\n",
    "2. **Writing:** A justification for your choice of priors (question 3 for a Bayesian). Be sure to explain why your choice of priors are \"uninformative\". \n",
    "3. **Plot:** Plots showing the traces of each parameter. On these plots, you should identify the \"burn-in period\".\n",
    "    - The \"burn-in period\" is the time it takes for your MCMC model to reach a stable state. Generally, it takes on the order of ~100-200 or so samples for this to happen. You can identify this period visually by looking at a plot of your walker's location over time.\n",
    "4. **Writing:** Some evaluation of how well the fit has converged (see below).\n",
    "5. **Plot:** 1D histograms of the parameter samples and 2D contour plots of parameter pairs. This is generally called a \"corner plot\" (In addition to doing this by hand as we have in class and on the homework, there are also packages like `corner` and others to do this, feel free to use what you like.)\n",
    "6. **Writing:** \"Best fit\" values and 68.3% confidence intervals from the 1D marginalized posteriors of each parameter. \n",
    "7. **Plot + Writing:** A plot of the best-fitting model lightcurve over the data, and some qualitative comments about how good a fit it appears to be. (Hint: Depending on your data set, you may need to zoom in quite a lot to get a good look)"
